The Euler theorem has found extensive applications in finance,
particularly for decomposing homogeneous risk measures of degree one.
However, a limitation of this approach is that it doesnâ€™t adequately
isolate the true sources of risk within an investment portfolio, thus
creating a gap in risk analysis.

The Minimum Torsion Bets (MTB) method offers a compelling solution to
this challenge. Leveraging spectral decomposition, MTB selectively
identifies uncorrelated factors that are as close as possible to the
original variables among all possible matrix rotations. This approach
ensures a refined understanding of the underlying risk structure.

The results of the MTB method yield a diversification distribution with
several noteworthy properties:

- It is always positive, reflecting a constructive aspect of risk
  management;
- The distribution sums to \$1\$, maintaining consistency with
  probabilistic principles;
- It accurately captures the true sources of risk, enabling a more
  precise and targeted risk management strategy;
- The distribution offers insightful interpretations, adding analytical
  value to the decision-making process.

In essence, the Effective Number of Minimum Torsion Bets (ENMTB) extends
traditional risk measures by providing a nuanced view of risk
diversification, making it a valuable tool for financial professionals
seeking to optimize portfolio performance.

## Example

``` r
library(uncorbets)

# prepare data
returns <- diff(log(EuStockMarkets))
covariance <- cov(returns)

# Minimum Torsion Matrix
torsion_mat <- torsion(covariance)

# Prior Allocation (equal weights, for example)
w <- rep(1 / ncol(returns), ncol(returns))

# Compute diversification distribution and the diversification level
effective_bets(b = w, sigma = covariance, t = torsion_mat)
